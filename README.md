# Data Analysis: Statistic Crime Analysis

* The objective of the project is data cleaning, statistical analysis through obtained metrics, and visualizations using different libraries within Python as well as the subsequent transfer to Tableau where the final graphs are.
* The cvs can be found on the official BA Data page: https://data.buenosaires.gob.ar/dataset/
* The implementation of various user functions where used to optimize the code for both cleanup and scanning while reducing memory usage.
* On the other hand, user functions were performed to carry out a statistical analysis on the different variables, allowing the optimization and automation of code to determine: standard deviation, quartiles, mean, mode, average, type of distribution, among other statistical metrics.
* After the cleaning and analysis, the visualization step of the project was carried out in Tableau: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/oliver.tomas/viz/DelitosCABA-CiudadAutnomadeBuenosAires/Dashboard2
